# Shorthand Molecule Analysis Tool (SMAT)

  In chemistry, shorthand is a method of drawing molecules that is simpler and easier than the standard drawing convention. Shorthand saves chemists time because it is faster to draw with and is also more efficient because it conveys the same information with a more minimalistic diagram.
  
  However, although this system is more efficient and concise, the main drawback of using shorthand is that as the molecules get bigger, it becomes more and more tedious to decipher the drawings. To make interpreting shorthand easier and more efficient, I developed the Shorthand Molecule Analysis Tool (SMAT) to serve as the foundation for a tool which would take the burden of deciphering these drawings off of chemists and automate this process to save chemists valuable time which could be spent creating valuable fertilizers, life-saving medicines, or other important products to help humanity.
